## Thoughts on the long-term version of the app and the UI Library

* [Yeoman React Webpack to start?](https://github.com/newtriks/generator-react-webpack)
* [Server-side rendering of React components](https://github.com/mhart/react-server-example) before sending them to the browser ([info](http://www.crmarsh.com/react-ssr/))
* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
* [docs.writethedocs.org](http://docs.writethedocs.org/) for reference on writing good documentation (should be linked in UI library)
* [ghooks (for dev environments _only_)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ghooks) 
  * Also for running SCSS Lint on our source files before commit
  * tests, etc.
