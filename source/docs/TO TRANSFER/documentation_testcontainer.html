                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>A bus modem for building and industrial electrical systems comprises a module (100) which comprises a pair of input pins (1, 2) destined to be connected to the bus and a pair of output pins (9, 10) destined to be connected to the electrical circuit of a device to be connected to the bus. The module (100) further comprises a voltage control circuit (3) able to take voltage from said bus and to control the voltage (VASB) on a capacitor (C1) disposed at the terminals of said output pins (9, 10), and a transmission control circuit (5) able to control an electronic switch (7) which controls a current limiting circuit (8) able to limit the current on the bus, during transmission of signals from the bus to the devices connected to the bus and vice versa.</p>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The present invention refers to a modem device for bus communication for building and industrial electrical systems, such as for example the bus known by the commercial name of "Konnex TPl bus", which makes it possible in a residential, tertiary and industrial setting to achieve integrated management of various systems such as, for example, electrical, heating, air conditioning, irrigation and anti-intrusion systems and technical alarms, such gas, water and smoke detectors.</p>

                <p>The modem according to the invention allows the supply voltage necessary for operation of the various control devices to be taken from the bus and provides the possibility of decoding the signals transmitted on the bus and of coding the signals to be transmitted on the bus.</p>

                <p>Communication between the modem and the bus is of the half-duplex, two-way type and the transmission support of the exchanged data is achieved by means of a single twisted pair of wires, also known as a duplex cable.</p>

                <p>The voltages present on the bus conductor cable are of the SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage) type.</p>
